        whenever the user requests a new piece of data. SPA  frontend and backend are sperate .SPA s falls behind in SCO optimization compaired to MPAs <br>
    MPA : stands for multipage application nar emore staple applications but they are slower then SP Applications because it must reload the page from scratch when ever u want to go to another page or get new data

    <p class="alert alert-success">angular is a complete framework for development of dynamic and complete web apps with backend
        where as react is a javascript library use to build ui designs for a complete webb ap or any other app development in react we have to attack back-end to it

    <strong class="alert alert-primary">Dom vs Virtual dom</strong>
    <p class="alert alert-success"> DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML it contains all the properties methods andevents of html elements.
        HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.if u make achange in ur html u have to refresh ur page to 
        see the change.
        
        The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal or virtual representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the real DOM. it only changes the component
        which is changed or altered without reloading or refreshing whole application
