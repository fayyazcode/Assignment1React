    <p>SPA : stands for single page application . SP Applications are faster because The page doesn’t reload entirely
        whenever the user requests a new piece of data. SPA  frontend and backend are sperate .SPA s falls behind in SCO optimization compaired to MPAs <br>
    MPA : stands for multipage application nar emore staple applications but they are slower then SP Applications because it must reload the page from scratch when ever u want to go to another page or get new data
    MPA’s, front-end and back-end are more interdependent. All coding is usually  under one project.MPA s gets higher ranking on google seo </p>
    
    <strong>React vs Angular</strong>
    <p>angular is a complete framework for development of dynamic and complete web apps with backend
        where as react is a javascript library use to build ui designs for a complete webb ap or any other app development in react we have to attack back-end to it
        angular is based on modal view controller where as react is is based on virtual dom. react is baised on javascript and angular is baised on typescript
    </p>
    <strong>library vs Framework</strong>
    <p>
        library vs Framework are reusable pre written code by someone else that is used to solve common problems
        if u are using an library u are incharege u can call any it any time and use it as u see fit .<br>
        if ur are using a framework , framwork is incharge and u have to follow through every rule and path pre defined in it
        u can build a complete application in a framework with backend . if u are using  libraries u have to use multiple of them to build a complete application 
        
    </p>
    <strong>Dom vs Virtual dom</strong>
    <p> DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML it contains all the properties methods andevents of html elements.
        HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.if u make achange in ur html u have to refresh ur page to 
        see the change.
        
        The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal or virtual representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the real DOM. it only changes the component
        which is changed or altered without reloading or refreshing whole application
